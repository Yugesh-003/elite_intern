# Elite Tech Internship Project

This repository contains my internship project submission for Elite Tech, focusing on various data science and machine learning tasks.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates proficiency in multiple areas of data science and machine learning through four distinct tasks:


### Task 1: Loan Approval Prediction
A machine learning model that predicts loan approval decisions based on applicant data. The model helps automate the initial screening process for loan applications.

### Task 2: Sentiment Analysis with NLP
A natural language processing (NLP) application that performs sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews. The implementation uses:
- TF-IDF vectorization for text representation
- Logistic Regression for classification
- Text preprocessing techniques including stopword removal
- Performance evaluation using classification metrics

### Task 3: Image Classification
A deep learning model that classifies images into "happy" and "sad" categories using TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of facial expressions and can predict the emotional state displayed in new images.

### Task 4: Movie Recommendation System
A collaborative filtering recommendation system built using the MovieLens dataset. The system suggests movies to users based on their past preferences and similar users' ratings.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
- **NLTK**: Natural language processing
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning for image classification
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk tensorflow
   ```
3. Download NLTK stopwords:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in order (Task-1 through Task-4)

## Results

- **Image Classification**: Achieved [accuracy metric] accuracy in classifying happy vs. sad images
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Successfully classified movie reviews with [accuracy metric] accuracy
- **Loan Approval Prediction**: Built a model with [accuracy metric] accuracy for predicting loan approvals
- **Movie Recommendation System**: Created a functional recommendation system with [metric] mean squared error

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced deep learning architectures for image classification
- Explore transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) for sentiment analysis
- Add more features and try ensemble methods for loan approval prediction
- Develop a hybrid recommendation system combining content-based and collaborative filtering
